Expensify offers several plans based on your needs: **Track, Submit, Collect, Control,** and **Free**. Your choice depends on whether you manage expenses individually, for a group, or for a company. You may need to upgrade if you hire employees who need access to a **Group Workspace** or require features exclusive to paid plans.

# Downgrading to a Free Account from a Group Plan

## Pay-Per-Use Plan
1. Go to **Settings > Workspaces > Group**.
2. Click the **cog icon** next to your Workspace name.
3. Select **Delete**.
   - **Note**: Deleting a Workspace removes its settings and members but does not delete their Expensify accounts.
   - If any members were active that month (submitted, approved, or edited reports), you will be billed for their usage.

## Annual Subscription
1. If eligible for a refund, go to **Settings > Account > Subscription**.
2. Click **Request a Refund** if:
   - You own a **Collect** or **Control** Group Workspace.
   - You have only been billed once.
   - You have no outstanding balance.

Once downgraded, your Workspace will be deleted, and a refund line item will appear in your **Billing History**.

# FAQ

## Will I be charged for a monthly subscription even if I don't use SmartScans?

Yes, monthly subscriptions are prepaid and not usage-based, so you will be charged regardless of activity.

## I'm in a Group Workspace. Do I need the monthly subscription too?

No, Group Workspace members already have unlimited **SmartScans**. However, you can keep a subscription for personal use if you leave your company's Workspace.
