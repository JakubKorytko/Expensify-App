## How to create an expense report

2. Select **Create report** to open a draft report on your default workspace.
  - Reports are opened on your default workspace. To switch workspaces select **More > Change workspace**.

## How to manually submit an expense report

1. Open an expense report that includes at least one expense.
2. Select **Submit**.

After submitting, the report status updates and a **“submitted”** entry appears in the activity at the bottom of the report. For details on what each report status means, see [Understanding Report Statuses](https://help.expensify.com/articles/new-expensify/reports-and-expenses/Understanding-Report-Statuses-and-Actions).

**Note:** If your workspace uses automatic submission, you’ll see **“Waiting for your expenses to automatically submit”** at the top of the report instead of a Submit button.

## How to edit or retract a submitted expense report 

If you submitted a report too early or need to make changes, you can retract it.

Retracting a report moves it back to **Draft**, so you can add, remove, or edit expenses.

1. Open the submitted report.
2. Select **More**.
3. Select **Retract**.

**Note:** Only the person who submitted the report can retract it.

# How Workspace Admins can create expense reports for members in New Expensify

Workspace Admins can create a new expense report in a member’s account by **moving expenses to a new report**. This is useful for grouping unreported company card expenses, separating expenses by accounting period or moving expenses out of an existing Draft report. 

Admins can create reports to move: 
- Reported or unreported **company card expenses**
- Reported **reimbursable expenses**

**Note:** If an expense is already on a report, that report must be in **Draft** or **Outstanding** status before the expense can be moved.

---

## How Workspace Admins can create a report by moving one expense

1. Open a reported or unreported company card expense, or a reported reimbursable expense.
2. In the expense details, select the **Report** title line.
3. Select **Create report** to add the expense to a report on the member's default workspace. 
   - You must be a Workspace Admin on that workspace.

**Note:** If the expense is already on a report, it can only be moved if the existing report is in Draft or Outstanding status.

## How Workspace Admins can create a report by moving multiple expenses

1. Select two or more reported or unreported company card expenses, or reported reimbursable expenses.
2. Select the **Selected** button.
3. Select **Move expenses**.
4. Select **Create report** to add the expenses to a report on the member's default workspace. 
   - You must be a Workspace Admin on that workspace.

This is useful when you need to:
- Group unreported company card expenses
- Separate expenses by accounting period
- Move expenses out of an existing Draft report

# Examples of expense report organization

You can organize expense reports in different ways depending on how you track and submit expenses. The examples below show common approaches.

## How to organize expense reports by client

Use separate reports to keep expenses tied to specific clients.

Examples:

- Create a report titled with the client name or project code.
- Add all expenses related to that client to the same report.
- Submit the report monthly or when the work is complete.

This makes client billing and expense review easier.

## How to organize expense reports by project

Use project-based reports to group expenses for a specific project or initiative.

Examples:

- Create a new report for each project.
- Use clear project names or tags in the report title.
- Add expenses as they occur or all at once.
- Submit the report when the project ends.

This helps keep project costs separate and easier to track.

## How to submit monthly expense reports

Use a monthly report when you submit expenses on a regular schedule.

Examples:

- Create a report at the start of the month.
- Use the month and year as the report title.
- Add expenses throughout the month.
- Submit the report at the end of the month.

This works well for standard reimbursement cycles.

## How to track travel expenses using expense reports

Use trip-based reports to group travel-related expenses.

Examples:

- Create a report before or during a trip.
- Add travel expenses as they happen or after the trip.
- Include receipts and notes when needed.
- Submit the report after the trip ends.

This keeps each trip’s expenses in one place.

## How to manage team or department expenses using expense reports

Use department-level reports when you’re managing expenses for a team.

Examples:

- Create a report named for the team or department.
- SmartScan team receipts into your own account.
- Add the expenses to the report.
- Submit the report based on your internal process.

**Note:** You can only include expenses captured in your own account. Expenses can’t be transferred between members. To manage or submit a report from another account, ask them to add you as a [Copilot](https://help.expensify.com/articles/new-expensify/settings/Copilot-Access).

# FAQ

## How can an Admin take these actions for another member?

Admins can create reports on behalf of members by moving expenses to a new report (see "How Admins can create reports on behalf of members" above). However, Admins cannot directly submit or retract reports for others. If you need to submit or manage someone else's reports, ask them to add you as a [Copilot](https://help.expensify.com/articles/new-expensify/settings/Copilot-Access).

## What happens if I forget to submit a report?

Unsubmitted reports will remain in your Open reports section. You can go back any time to add more expenses or submit when ready. If your workspace uses instant submit, valid expenses may auto-submit to a new report without you needing to manually do it. 

## Why don’t I see the “Submit” button?

The Submit button only appears once your report includes at least one valid expense. If the report has already been submitted, the button will no longer be visible.

## Can I remove an expense after submitting?

Yes. You’ll need to retract the report using More > Retract, depending on the report's state. Then you can remove or edit expenses before resubmitting.
