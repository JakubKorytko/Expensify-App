## What's the difference between the Top Merchants report and other insights reports?

Each report provides a different view of your spending:

- **Top Merchants** shows which **vendors** received the most payments
- **Top Categories** shows the highest-spending **expense types** (e.g., Travel, Meals)
- **Top Spenders** shows which **employees** submitted the most expenses

All reports help identify trends from different perspectives to support better financial decisions.

## How is the Top Merchants report calculated?

The report uses all expenses from the previous calendar month and groups them by merchant. It shows the **top 10 merchants** based on total spend.

## Why do some merchant names look different?

Merchant names are captured from receipt data and card transactions. The same vendor might appear under different names (e.g., "Amazon.com" vs "AMZN Marketplace"). You may need to review the individual expenses to confirm they're from the same merchant.
