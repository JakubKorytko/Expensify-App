## How Insights work

Each Insight is powered by Expensify's search query engine using grouping filters and operators. The reports:

- Automatically group expenses by relevant dimensions (employee, category, merchant, time period)
- Calculate totals and counts
- Sort results to show the highest values first
- Update dynamically as new expenses are added

By default, Insights show data from the previous calendar month and display the top 10 results.

---

## Viewing modes

Insights can be displayed in two formats:

**Bar Chart View**

The default view for most Insights. Shows a visual bar chart with grouped data, making it easy to compare values at a glance.

**Table View**

Shows the same data in a traditional table format with rows and columns. Useful for detailed analysis or when you need to view more data points.

To switch between views:
1. Open any Insight report
2. Click **View** in the top navigation
3. Select **Bar chart** or **Table**

## Customizing Insights

While you can't modify the suggested Insight searches directly, you can:

1. **Apply additional filters** - Add date ranges, workspaces, or employee filters
2. **Create custom searches** - Use the same grouping operators to build your own reports
3. **Export underlying data** - Expand groups and export individual expenses to CSV

To create a custom report based on an Insight:
1. Start with an Insight as your template
2. Modify filters to match your needs
3. Click **Save search** to save your custom version

- **group-by:category** - Group by expense category
- **group-by:merchant** - Group by merchant or vendor
- **group-by:tag** - Group by expense tags
- **group-by:month** - Group by calendar month
- **group-by:week** - Group by calendar week
- **group-by:quarter** - Group by fiscal quarter

You can use these operators in custom searches to create your own insights and analyze spending from different perspectives.
